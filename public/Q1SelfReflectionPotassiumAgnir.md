### (1) List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

* **If-Else Statements**

If-else statements helped me control the flow of my code based on certain conditions. I learned how to use them to make decision, such as checking if a user's input is correct or if it meets the conditions.

* **Arrays**
    
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. I understand how to declare them, access their elements, and use common array methods such as .push() and .pop(). I believe that they are useful when working with lists or collections of data.

* **JavaScript Basic Structures**

I learned how to write basic statements such as variable declaration and function calls. It helped me understand and use the different functions of if-else, loops, and switch statements.

* **Declaring Variables**

Because I was able to learn how to declare variables in C++ when I was in 8th Grade, I was able to understand and grasp this topic more efficiently. I learned how to use var, let, and const which helped me so that the program can manage and use the data correctly and efficiently.

*  **Arithmetic Operators**

I am already comfortable with performing arithmetic operations in JS such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, I learned and understood the use of other operators such as the compount assignment operators, modulus, increment/decrement, and math functions like Math.random() or Math.floor().

### (2) List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

> **Event Handlers**

Event handlers are used to respond to user interactions like clicking a button (just like our bonus task: the Guessing Game). I sort of understand different types of events like click, input, and submit. Overall, this makes my JS code more interactive and dynamic to make it interesting/entertaining to the users

> **For Loops**
    
For loops in JavaScript are used to repeat a block of code of a certain number of times. I slightly understand how to use the for loop with different types of conditions and counters. Though I still require more practice on this, it helps me iterate over arrays or perform repeated operating functions like printing numbers.

> **Functions**

Functions helped me organize my code in reusable blocks. I learned how to define them and how to return them. Functions helped me write cleaner and more organized codes as well.

> **Debugging a Code**

Debugging is the process of looking for and fixing problems or issues in the code. I know its importance, however I sometimes struggle to identify what's wrong (my 7th graded exercise took me an hour and 30 minutes!)  but with more practice I know I'll be able to debug faster and write even cleaner codes!

> **While and Do-While Loops**

It is used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true. I sometimes confuse them with loops or forget when is the best time to use either of them. I believe that if I practice using these loops more, it will help me code other tasks that require repetition.

### (3) Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

To better understand the topics, I plan to spend more time practicing hands-on coding exercises, especially for concepts like event handlers, loops, functions, and debugging. For example, for event handlers, I will create small games in order to apply this topic into my code. For debugging, I will make sure to properly learn and remember the recommended symbol or substitute to the error. With consistent practice, I believe I can strengthen my understanding of these topics and overall become more confident in writing my codes.

### (4) In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

For me, one of the most effective activities done during class would be some hands-on coding exercises in class that sometimes provide bonuses. These were effective because they allowed to immediately apply the concepts we learned, like loops, arrays, etc. Writing code in real time and getting feedback helped me understand these concepts more and taught me how to debug errors on the spot. Moreover, another effective activity we have done is sometimes coding along with our teacher. Watching him write and explain his code helped me grasp the concept even more. It gave me the chance to follow along and to fix mistakes.

Some ineffective activities could be that some of our quizzes tested the definitions or syntax rule without asking us how to really analyze a code as it is usually in the last 2 questions only. Moreover, we were assigned with tasks which required difficult concepts which weren't discussed in detail during class, so it was slightly hard to comprehend them.
